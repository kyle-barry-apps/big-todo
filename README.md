# Kanban Task Management

This is a full-scale task management application, similar to Asana, with board, task, subtask, and column interactivity. It is built in React and uses Redux for state management.

A GURU project on frontendmentor, this front-end app is considered among the largest and most difficult challenges available.

An app like this can always be improved, but I learned an enormous amount in the process.
